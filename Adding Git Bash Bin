Adding Git Bash's bin directory to the system's PATH environment variable allows tools like Jenkins to find and use the sh command. Here's how you can do it:

Steps to Add Git Bash to PATH in Windows
-----------------------------------------

First locate Git Bash's bin Directory:

By default, the bin directory is in Git's installation folder. For example:

C:\Program Files\Git\bin

Ensure this path exists on your system.

Open Environment Variables Settings:

Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and press Enter.

Then Go to the Advanced tab and click Environment Variables.

Modify the PATH Variable:

Under System variables, find and select the Path variable, then click Edit.

Click New and add the path to Git Bash's bin directory, e.g.,:

C:\Program Files\Git\bin

Save and Apply Changes:

Click OK to close all dialogs and save the changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verify PATH Update:
----------------------

Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type:
bash

sh --version

If sh is found, it means the PATH has been updated successfully.

Configure Jenkins to Use sh (Optional):

If Jenkins still cannot find sh, restart the Jenkins service to ensure it picks up the updated PATH.
Validation in Jenkins
Test the configuration by creating a Jenkins pipeline or freestyle job and running a simple sh step:
bash
Copy code
sh 'echo "Git Bash is working!"'
If the command executes successfully, the setup is complete!
